# Blind75_Solutions
Welcome to the Blind 75 Leetcode Solutions repository! This repository contains solutions to the Blind 75 Leetcode questions in Java. Blind 75 is a curated list of popular coding interview questions often asked by top technology companies.
# Repository Structure
This repository will contain three main folders: Easy, Medium and Hard (separating questions based on their difficulty). And you will find a separate folder for each question from the Blind 75 Leetcode list. Each folder is named after the respective question and each question contains various solutions with different time and space complexities. These solutions offer different perspectives and approaches to solving the problem. Additionally, most questions have both iterative and recursive solutions.
Please note that while the recursive solutions provided are concise and easy to understand, they often come with a higher space complexity due to the recursive call stack. Therefore, it's essential to consider the trade-offs between time and space when choosing an appropriate solution for a specific scenario.


Happy coding and best of luck with your interview preparation!
